`mldoeR` stands for **M**ixed-**l**evel **d**esigns **o**f **e**xperiments in **R**.
The goal of the package is to provide:

* Access to the catalog of regular four-and-two-level designs created by Bohyn, Schoen & Goos.
* Functions to characterize these designs, using different criteria such as:
  + Word length pattern
  + Aberration
  + ...
