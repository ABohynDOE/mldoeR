# Introduction

This is the `mldoeR` package. It contains a catalog of regular four-and-two-level designs.
It also contains useful functions to handle and analyze those designs.

# Search-table

For visualization purposes, you might want to generate a search-table.
The `searchTable()` function makes this possible for two-level designs.
The search-table for $2^{6-2}$ designs of resolution $III$ looks like this.

```{r}
st <- searchtable(n = 6, p = 2, r = 3)
print(st)
```
If you want to generate search-table for mixed-level designs, the `mSearchtable()` function is there.
For example, you can generate the search-table for $4^{1}2^{5}$ designs of resolution $III$ in $2^5$ runs.

```{r}
mST <- mixed_searchtable(m = 1, k = 5, p = 2, r = 3)
print(mST)
```

# Generators

In these search-table, the generators are presented as strings.
However, you can easily obtain the string representation of a generator from its number using the `num2char()` function.

```{r}
num2char(15)
```
